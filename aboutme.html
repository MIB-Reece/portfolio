						<h3>How it all started</h3>
						<p>Since primary school my parents enrolled me in extra curricular activities regarding computer science; I was obsessed with video games and attempted to reverse engineer some of the things I enjoyed.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>The following years</h3>
								<p>I gained interest in computer programming when I was in middle school I learned a multitude of basic business skills and became comfortable with office work; my family always had a home office thanks to my dad. In highschool I became fluent with HTML5, stronger with javascript and proficient in Web Design thanks to my enthusiastic teachers that gave me a fun learning journey. History and Computer Science were always my favorite school subjects.</p>

								<h3>The start of my professional work</h3>
								<p>As I grew up I lost interest in being a game developer. I gained a new found appreciation for people with the determination to create the entertainment that we take for granted. I found it easier to expand my software engineering skills by building multiple websites for online businesses. my E-commerce experience gave me a new perspective on what companies need to dominate the market as more sales move online.</p>
